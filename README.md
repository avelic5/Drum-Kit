# 🥁 Drum Kit

Welcome to the **Drum Kit** project – a fun little web app where you can play the drums using your keyboard or by clicking the buttons! 🎶  

## 🚀 How it works

- Click any button on the screen (`w, a, s, d, j, k, l`) or press the same key on your keyboard.  
- Each button plays a different drum sound (crash, kick, snare, toms).  
- A short animation shows which button is currently active.  

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** – page structure  
- **CSS3** – styling and animations  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – event listeners and audio playback
